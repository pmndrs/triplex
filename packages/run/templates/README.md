Thanks for being an early adopter!
If you find Triplex useful think about [sponsoring the project](https://github.com/sponsors/itsdouges),
with more sponsors more time can be spent on development.

## Commands

Run the CLI to browse available commands:

```bash
npx triplex
```

### Editor

Triplex ships with an embedded editor to visually build out your React Three Fiber components:

```bash
{pkg_manager} run editor
```

Using the `--open [path]` option you can have the editor open in your default browser immediately.
The optional `[path]` flag opens a specific file.
