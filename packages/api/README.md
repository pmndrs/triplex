```

### Koota

Helpers for [Koota](https://github.com/pmndrs/koota) that make it easier to use with Triplex.

#### `createSystem(system: Function, args: string | object)`

Creates an ECS systems to be used in conjunction with `injectSystems`. Args are optional and can be a `string` or an `object`:

- `string` — defines the system name which will then show up in provider controls. This system is always running by default. Disable by clicking the "pause(SystemName)" checkbox.
- `{ dev: boolean, name: string }` — defines the system name and declares a system as "dev". This system is paused by default. Run it by clicking the "run(SystemName)" checkbox.

#### `injectSystems(component: Function, args: System[])`

Higher-order component that injects the [canvas provider](https://triplex.dev/docs/building-your-scene/providers#canvas-provider) with systems created from `createSystem`.

These systems are:

1. Added to the frame loop and automatically run when inside Triplex.
1. Added to provider input controls enabling you to run / pause them as needed.
