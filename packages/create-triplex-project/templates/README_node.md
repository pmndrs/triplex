## Commands

Run the CLI to browse available commands:

npx triplex
```

### Editor

Triplex ships with an embedded editor to visually build out your React Three

```

Using the `--open [path]` option you can have the editor open in your default
browser immediately. The optional `[path]` flag opens a specific file.
