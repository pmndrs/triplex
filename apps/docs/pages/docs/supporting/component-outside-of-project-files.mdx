title: Component Outside of Project Files
---

This file lives outside of what you have declared your project files to be in
the [Triplex config](/docs/api-reference/config#files), meaning Triplex won't be
able to find it when opening files.

To resolve, either:

1. Update your config to include the folder the component is inside:

   <MetaDiff source="files" target="path" action="add" transform="glob" />

2. Move the file underneath one of the directories defined in the `files`
   property of your config:

   <PickMeta pick="files" />
