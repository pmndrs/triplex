title: How To Resolve Type Errors With Static Assets
---

If your project directly imports static assets such as `glb` and `gltf` you'll
also need to define that they're strings so the TypeScript compiler knows what
they are.

Define them in a `/types/assets.d.ts` file:

```ts
declare module "*.glb" {
  const content: string;
  export default content;
}

declare module "*.gltf" {
  const content: string;
  export default content;
}
```

TypeScript now considers them to be strings when imported.
