## Troubleshoot Installing Dependencies

Triplex uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) to source third-party artifacts,
however you need a _package manager_ to have them installed into your project.

Triplex doesn't (currently) come with an out-of-the-box package manager so you
need to install one yourself.

## pnpm

Install using a standalone script.

See [pnpm's installation docs](https://pnpm.io/installation) for more
information.

### Windows

Using PowerShell:

```
iwr https://get.pnpm.io/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```

### macOS

```
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
```

## npm

Install together with Node.js. The easiest way is to use an installer, find one
on the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

See
[npm's installation docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
for more information.

## Yarn

Install together with Node.js. The easiest way is to use an installer, find one
on the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Afterwards use
`corepack` to enable `yarn`:

```sh
corepack enable
corepack prepare yarn@stable --activate
```

See [Yarn's installation docs](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) for
more information.
