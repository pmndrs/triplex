# Troubleshooting Context Not Found

You have duplicate dependencies somewhere caused by your package manager.

## pnpm

When pnpm@8 was introduced it set a new config `dedupe-peer-dependents` to
`true`. This results in undefined behavior with some peer dependencies being
duplicated.

Create a `.npmrc` file in the root of your project with this content:

```
dedupe-peer-dependents=false
```

And then run `pnpm install` to refresh node_modules.

If the problem persists try deduplicating your dependencies:

```sh
pnpm dedupe
```

## Yarn

Try and deduplicate your dependencies.

```sh
npx yarn-deduplicate # yarn@1
```

```sh
yarn dedupe # yarn@2+
```

## npm

Try and deduplicate your dependencies.

```
npm dedupe
```
