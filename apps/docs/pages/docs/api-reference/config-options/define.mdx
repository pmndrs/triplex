For advanced use case to replace strings inside source code with arbitrary values. For greater Ecosystem compatibility of your components we recommend not relying on this.

## Usage

Each key will be replaced by its value at runtime.

```json filename=".triplex/config.json"
{
  "define": {
    "process.env.NODE_ENV": "development"
  }
}
```
