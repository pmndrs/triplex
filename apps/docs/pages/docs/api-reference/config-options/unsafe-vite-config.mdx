title: UNSAFE_viteConfig
description: Define custom bundler configuration that otherwise can't be handled by default behavior.
---

Occasionally projects need custom behavior to run using custom plugins, code transformations, or other bundler-specific features. Use with caution, this is inherently unsafe and its usage can cause upgrade pain when new versions of Triplex are released.

## Usage

Pass a relative path to your Vite config. Your config and the internal config will be merged together, with the internal one taking priority.

```json filename=".triplex/config.json"
{
  "UNSAFE_viteConfig": "./vite.config.js"
}
```

```js filename="vite.config.js"
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { customPlugin } from "./my-plugins";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [customPlugin()],
});
```
