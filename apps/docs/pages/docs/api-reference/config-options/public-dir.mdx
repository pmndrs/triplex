Defaults to `"../public"`.

## Usage

Pass a relative path to your public directory. If you're using a bundler such as [Vite](https://vite.dev/config/shared-options.html#publicdir) for building your project this value should match.

```json filename=".triplex/config.json"
{
  "publicDir": "../assets"
}
```
