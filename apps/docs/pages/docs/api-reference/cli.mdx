initializes Triplex inside a new or pre-existing repository. If the repository
is new it will create a new folder for you, if it's pre-existing it will
configure your repository and install example files.

### Interactive

```bash
npx @triplex/run@latest init
```

You will be asked a series of prompts:

```bash
? What should we call your project? …
? What package manager do you use? …
? Will initialize into your existing repository, continue? (Y/n) › true
```

And then be presented the option to open the editor with the example scene.

## Editor

Start the Triplex editor by running:

```sh
npx triplex editor
```
