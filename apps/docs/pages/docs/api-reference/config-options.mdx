Configuration is is located in the .triplex folder from the root of your project and is optional.

When you need to create one you can run the following commands in your terminal.

```bash filename="<root>"
npx make-dir-cli .triplex
npx touch .triplex/config.json
```

To have autocomplete for configuration in your IDE make sure to declare the `"$schema"` property.

```json filename=".triplex/config.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://triplex.dev/config.schema.json"
}
```
