## Literal Types

### string

A string type is displayed as a text input.

```tsx /name: string/
export function Component(props: { name: string });
```

### number

A number type is displayed as a number input.

```tsx /size: number/
export function Component(props: { size: number });
```

### boolean

A boolean type is displayed as a checkbox input.

```tsx /isHidden: boolean/
export function Component(props: { isHidden: boolean });
```

## Union Types

### Literal types

A union type prop which has all literal types is displayed as a select input.

```tsx /variant: "primary" | "secondary" | "tertiary"/
export function Component(props: {
  variant: "primary" | "secondary" | "tertiary";
});
```

### Mixed types

A union type prop which has mixed types is displayed as the appropriate input for each type.

```tsx /color: string | number | [number, number, number]/
export function Component(props: {
  color: string | number | [number, number, number];
});
```

Switch between types using the <ActionLink name="Switch Prop Type" icon={SwitchIcon} href="/docs/building-your-scene/components/editing-props#cycle-through-prop-types" /> action.

## Tuple Types

A tuple type prop is a finite list of types in an array. It is displayed as a list of inputs appropriate for each individual type.

Here the position prop will be displayed as three number inputs.

```tsx /position: [number, number, number]/
export function Component(props: { position: [number, number, number] });
```
