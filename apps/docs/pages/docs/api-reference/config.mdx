Your Triplex project can be configured in the `.triplex/config.json` file.

## Options

### Files

The `files` option is a glob array of relative paths used to tell Triplex what
files it can open. You can define multiple roots. These found files will be
displayed in the `File` > `Open` menu.

**Example**

```json
{
  "files": ["../src/**/*.tsx"]
}
```

### Components

The `components` option is a glob array of relative paths used to tell Triplex
what files should be available to add. You can define multiple roots.

Defaults to `[]`.

**Example**

```json
{
  "components": ["../src/components/**/*.tsx"]
}
```

### Public directory

The public directory can be used to expose files through the local dev server,
such as images, videos, and GLTF files. For example if the public directory
includes a `public/image.png` image it will be made available at
`http://localhost:3333/image.png`.

Defaults to `"../public"`.

**Example**

```json
{
  "publicDir": ["../public"]
}
```

### Assets directory

Folder inside the public directory folder where Triplex maintains static assets
such as GLTF and GLB files. Files inside this directory are made available to be
added to the open component as a `GLTF` element.

Defaults to `"assets"`.

**Example**

```json
{
  "assetsDir": "mesh"
}
```

### Provider

Use the `provider` property to point to a component that can declare any extra
elements that should be rendered to the scene, such as
[React Context provider](https://react.dev/reference/react/createContext#provider)
components like the XR component from `@react-three/xr`. Props your provider
takes can be set in the Triplex UI,
[learn more](/docs/user-guide/provider-config).

The provider component **must** be the default export and return children.

```json
{
  "provider": "./provider.tsx"
}
```

```js
import { XR } from "@react-three/xr";

export default function Provider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }}) {
  return <XR>{children}</XR>;
}
```
