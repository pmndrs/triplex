# create-triplex-project

The easiest way to get started with Triplex is by using
`create-triplex-project`. It initializes Triplex inside a new or pre-existing
repository. If the repository is new it will create a new folder for you, if
it's pre-existing it will configure your repository and install example files.

### Interactive

You can create a project interactively by running:

```bash
npx create-triplex-project
```

You will be asked a series of prompts:

```bash
? What should we call your project? …
? What package manager do you use? …
? Will initialize into your existing repository, continue? (Y/n) › true
```

And then be presented the option to open the editor with the example scene.
