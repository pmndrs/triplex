[Leva](https://github.com/pmndrs/leva) is a hooks-based GUI for React that is
used to display controls during development. When developing inside Triplex
you're able to get a similar experience as Leva with the added benefit of
keeping your components portable.

Take a standard Leva config inside a component:

```tsx
const { color, isEnabled, scale } = useControls({
  color: "#fff",
  isEnabled: false,
  scale: 4,
});
```

You can instead represent this config as props your component takes.

```tsx
interface Props {
  color: string;
  isEnabled: boolean;
  scale: number;
}

export function Component(props: Props);
```

Which are then able to have their values be changed in its
[Component Controls](/docs/guides/component-controls).

## Constraints

Similar to Leva, props can have values be constrained by using JSDoc tags. Take
a Leva config that sets constraints on the `scale` value.

```tsx
useControls({
  scale: {
    value: 4,
    min: 0,
    max: 10,
  },
});
```

You can instead represent these constraints as JSDoc tags on your prop.

```tsx
interface Props {
  /**
   * @min 0
   * @max 10
   */
  scale: number;
}
```

For an exhaustive list of tags see
[Declaring Props](/docs/get-started/declaring-props#tags).

## Complex props

Complex props such as tuples are also supported. Take a Leva config that
declares a number tuple;

```tsx
useControls({
  boxSize: [10, 20],
});
```

You can instead represent this as a tuple prop.

```tsx
interface Props {
  boxSize: [number, number];
}
```

For an exhaustive list of types that are supported see
[Declaring Props](/docs/get-started/declaring-props).
