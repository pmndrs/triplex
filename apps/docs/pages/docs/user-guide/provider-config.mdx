A provider component is used to set up the global environment of your app, such
as physics or post-processing.

When [defining it in config](/docs/api-reference/config#provider) any prop that
it takes can be modified in the UI, allowing you to tailor your project
configuration to your needs. Access it through the "view provider controls"
action in the scene panel.

![Triplex UI](/ui/provider-config.png)

As an example if your provider declares `debugPhysics` and `enablePhysics`
boolean props they will be available for you to toggle in the UI.

```tsx
export default function Provider({
  children,
  debugPhysics = false,
  enablePhysics = false,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  debugPhysics: boolean;
  enablePhysics: boolean;
}): JSX.Element;
```

All props that Triplex supports work here, including
[prop tags](/docs/user-guide/prop-tags). For example defining a string literal
union will present a dropdown menu in the UI:

```tsx
export default function Provider({
  children,
  environment = "city",
}: {
  environment: "ocean" | "city" | "country";
  children: React.ReactNode;
}): JSX.Element;
```
