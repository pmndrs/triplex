Edit props of the currently opened component without writing any boiler plate
code that persist for the duration of your session.

For the component you want to edit click the "live edit props" action in the
scene panel and you're presented with all the props it takes available to be
edited.

After you're done you can click the "clear props" action in the context panel to
reset the prop values back to default.
