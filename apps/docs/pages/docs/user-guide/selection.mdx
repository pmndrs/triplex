# Selection

The right panel displays information about the selected element, such as the
name, links to source, available actions, and a list of available props.

## Actions

There are multiple actions available to perform against the selected element.

### Enter Component

![Enter the selected component in the right sidebar](/enter-selected-action.png)

Entering a component transitions the editor to the selected elements component,
all other components in the original scene will no-longer be rendered. When
transitioned all props that can be serialized will be passed along and set on
the entered component.

Currently React context is not forwarded, if your component relies on any and
throws when it's missing, it will throw when entering.

**Hotkeys**

- `Shift` + `F`

### Focus Camera

![Focus the selected component in the right sidebar](/focus-selected-action.png)

The focus camera action moves the camera to the selected element.

**Hotkeys**

- `F`

### Delete

![Delete the selected component in the right sidebar](/delete-selected-action.png)

The delete action removes the selected element from the open component. If
accidental it can be undone using the undo action.

**Hotkeys**

- `Backspace`

## Element Props

![Edit the selected components' props in the right sidebar](/props-list.png)

All supported props are shown here including props that are not yet declared on
the element. For props that take union types (multiple options) you're able to
switch between them using the switch prop type action next to the prop field.

For example this will show a color field with no switch prop type action:

```ts
interface Props {
  color: string;
}
```

This will show a select field with no switch prop type action:

```ts
interface Props {
  color: "red" | "yellow" | "blue";
}
```

And this will show an array field with a switch prop type action to switch
between union types:

```ts
interface Props {
  color: [number, number, number] | string;
}
```
