title: Live Editing
---

Triplex two-way syncs between the editor and your source code. Making changes
and saving inside the editor will update your source code, likewise editing the
source code and saving will update the editor. There's no abstraction,
boilerplate code, or any wiring up to make this work.

When making changes in the editor they are not persisted to disk until you save,
before which you're able to undo / redo your changes as you see fit. When saving
the undo / redo stacks are cleared.
