Triplex is a powerful visual editor for React Three Fiber. Triplex two-way syncs
between the editor and your source code, making changes and saving inside the
editor will update your source code, likewise editing the source code and saving
will update the editor. There's no abstraction, boilerplate code, or any wiring
up to make this work.
