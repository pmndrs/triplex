## What is Triplex?

Triplex is your visual workspace for building [React](https://react.dev) / [Three Fiber](https://r3f.docs.pmnd.rs) components. Build 2D and 3D components without coding using its visual and input controls. Jump down to code when you need.

<KnowledgeCallout>
  Did you know? The Triplex renderer is [open source on
  GitHub](https://github.com/trytriplex/triplex) (it's what renders your 2D and
  3D components!). If you've never contributed to an open source project before
  today's a good day to dip your toes, check out [these issues to get
  started](https://github.com/trytriplex/triplex/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22Contribution%20ready%22)
  and make sure to join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/nBzRBUEs4b).

## Highlight Features

- **Visual Controls**: Update props visually using controls like transform controls.
- **Input Controls**: Component props become inputs in the editor.
- **Editor Workflow**: Changes can be undone, repeated, and saved back to code.
- **Code, Synced**: Code changes are reflected back in the editor.

## Pre-Requisite Knowledge

If you've used React and built components before then you'll have no issues using Triplex. If you haven't â€” don't worry you can learn as you go. Some folks have even started learning React using Triplex!

Here's some resources to get started:

- If you're new to React we recommend following the [React: Quick Start guide](https://react.dev/learn)
- If you're new to Three Fiber or Three.js we recommend taking the [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/lessons/what-are-react-and-react-three-fiber) course
- For a high level introduction to Triplex and Three Fiber see [Starting a Project: Your First 3D Component](/docs/get-started/starting-a-project/your-first-3d-component)
