## What is Triplex?

Triplex is a visual <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr> for building [React](https://react.dev) / [Three Fiber](https://r3f.docs.pmnd.rs) components. It frees you up to focus on building. Triplex manages your development environment, provides productivity capabilities, and enables both visual and code-first workflows.

## Highlight Features

- **Familiar Editor Workflows**: Make changes that can be undone, repeated, and saved back to your source code.
- **Always In-Sync**: Changes made to your source code are reflected in the editor in real-time.
- **Scene Tools**: In-built tools to help visualize and edit your components.
- **User Controlled Dependencies**: Triplex uses your projects dependencies for React, Three Fiber, and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

## Pre-Requisite Knowledge

Having a basic understanding of React and its component model helps immensely when building with Triplex, but you can learn as you go. Some folks have even started learning React using Triplex at the same time!

Here are some resources to get you started:

- For a high level introduction to Triplex and Three Fiber see [Starting a Project: Your First 3D Component](/docs/get-started/starting-a-project/your-first-component)
- If you're new to React we recommend following the [React: Quick Start guide](https://react.dev/learn)
- If you're new to Three Fiber or Three.js we recommend taking the [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/lessons/what-are-react-and-react-three-fiber) course
