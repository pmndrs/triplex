## What is Triplex?

Triplex is a visual <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr> for building through a [React](https://react.dev) component API using [React Three Fiber](https://r3f.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction). It lets you focus on building by handling your development environment, providing productivity tools like transform controls & scene helpers, and saving changes you make back to source code.

## Highlight Features

- **Visual Development**: Update the props of your custom components and host elements through the editor UI with a familiar editor experience.
- **Scene Helpers**: See where your lights, cameras, and more are without writing code.
- **Code Sync**: Changes made in the editor are saved back to your source code, and vice versa.
- **Managed Dependencies**: Triplex uses your projects dependencies for React, React Three Fiber, and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

## Useful Knowledge

Having a basic understanding of Node.js, its package managers, React, Three.js, and React Three Fiber helps immensely when building with Triplex.
