Let's create your first component with Triplex! No experience is needed to follow along however it's assumed you have a project set up after following [Starting a Project](/docs/get-started/starting-a-project).

## Creating a New File

First we are going to make a new file to build our scene in. With Visual Studio Code open:

1. Create a new file and save it in the src directory of your project, we've called it `new-scene.tsx`.

1. Copy the following code into the file.

   ```tsx filename="src/new-scene.tsx"
   export function Scene() {
     return <></>;
   }
   ```

1. Click the <ActionLink name="Open in Triplex" href="#" /> CodeLens action above the Scene component. Nothing will appear in the scene yet.

1. Copy the highlighted code into your component. A box will appear in the scene.

   ```tsx filename="src/new-scene.tsx" {4-7}
   export function Scene() {
     return (
       <>
         <mesh>
           <boxGeometry />
           <meshStandardMaterial />
         </mesh>
       </>
     );
   }
   ```

1. Click & drag over the scene to rotate the camera around.

1. Click the box in the scene to focus it. When focused press the <Kbd>F</Kbd> key to zoom the camera to it.

<KnowledgeCallout>
  The built-in Camera Controls let you view your scene from different
  viewpoints. Try zooming in & out by scrolling, and panning by holding `Shift`
  then dragging.
</KnowledgeCallout>

## Adding More Shapes

Now let's add some more shapes to fill the scene out.

1. Copy the highlighted code into your component. A sphere will appear in the scene.

   ```tsx filename="src/new-scene.tsx" {5-7}
   export function Scene() {
     return (
       <>
         ...
         <mesh>
           <sphereGeometry />
         </mesh>
       </>
     );
   }
   ```

1. Copy the highlighted code into your component. The sphere is now shaded.

   ```tsx filename="src/new-scene.tsx" {7}
   export function Scene() {
     return (
       <>
         ...
         <mesh>
           <sphereGeometry />
           <meshStandardMaterial />
         </mesh>
       </>
     );
   }
   ```

1. Click the sphere in the scene, then click the <ActionLink icon={MoveIcon} href="/docs/building-your-scene/learn-the-ui/scene#translate" name="Translate" /> action in the Scene Controls, then finally move the sphere off the box.

<KnowledgeCallout>
  The built-in Transform Controls are shown on selected elements. If the element
  doesn't declare the prop for the selected transform mode it will be disabled.
</KnowledgeCallout>

Before continuing try adding a cylinder mesh yourself. Make sure to save changes using the <ActionLink icon="⌘ + S" href="/docs/building-your-scene/learn-the-ui/other#save" name="Save" /> action!

## Adding Lights

Now let's add [three-point lighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_lighting) to the scene.

1. When no lights are present in the scene default lights are turned on. Click the <ActionLink icon={SunIcon} href="/docs/building-your-scene/learn-the-ui/scene#turn-onoff-default-lights" name="Turn Off Default Lights" /> action in the Scene Controls to turn them off. Click it again to turn it back on.

1. Copy the highlighted code into your component. A point light will appear in the scene.

   ```tsx filename="src/new-scene.tsx" {5}
   export function Scene() {
     return (
       <>
         ...
         <pointLight />
       </>
     );
   }
   ```

1. With the point light selected, go to the scene panel and update its `name` prop to "Key light".

1. Position the key light in front and to the side of the scene.

1. Duplicate the key light by selecting it then using the <ActionLink icon="⌘ + D" href="/docs/building-your-scene/learn-the-ui/scene-panel#duplicate-element" name="Duplicate Element" /> action. Name the duplicated light "Fill light" and move it to the opposite side of the scene.

1. Create the last light by adding another point light named "Backlight" then move it to the back of the scene.

<KnowledgeCallout>
  The built-in Scene Helpers are shown for select objects such as lights and
  cameras helping you see where they have been positioned in your scene.
</KnowledgeCallout>

Before continuing try adjusting the lights `intensity` and `color` props in the scene panel. The key light should have the highest intensity, then about half as much for the fill light, and then the backlight about the same.

## Adding a Camera

Now let's add a camera to the scene.

1. Install [Drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei) — a companion library for Three Fiber.

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   npm i @react-three/drei
   ```

1. Copy the highlighted code into your component then jump back into Triplex for VS Code. A camera will appear in the scene.

   ```tsx filename="new-scene.tsx" {1,7}
   import { PerspectiveCamera } from "@react-three/drei";

   export function Untitled() {
     return (
       <>
         ...
         <PerspectiveCamera />
       </>
     );
   }
   ```

1. Position and rotate the camera at an angle in-front of the scene. We're operating on vibes here so do what feels good!

1. Click the <ActionLink icon={WorldSpaceIcon} href="/docs/building-your-scene/learn-the-ui/scene#set-worldlocal-transform" name="Set Local Transform" /> action in the Scene Controls. Transforms now operate in local space, when translating the camera it will move in the direction it's facing. Click again to move back to global space.

1. On the camera set the `makeDefault` prop to be checked. When playing your scene this camera will now be used.

1. Click the <ActionLink icon={PlayIcon} href="/docs/building-your-scene/learn-the-ui/scene#play-scene" name="Play" /> action in the Scene Controls to run the scene through your camera.

1. Click the <ActionLink icon={CaretDownIcon} href="/docs/building-your-scene/learn-the-ui/scene#play-options" name="Play Options" /> action next to the Play action to switch to other cameras.

<KnowledgeCallout>
  Play Controls let you run and interact with your scene. When pressing the stop
  or the reset action your scene is reset to its initial state.
</KnowledgeCallout>

Before continuing try adjusting the camera `fov`, `near` and `far` props in the scene panel. They control the field of view and where objects are rendered in relation to the camera.

## Component Props

Finally we're going to add some props to your component.

1. Add two props to your component, the `backlight` prop should be a boolean that defaults to `true` and the `backlightColor` prop should be a string.

   ```tsx filename="new-scene.tsx" {2,3,5,6}
   export function Untitled({
     backlight = true,
     backlightColor,
   }: {
     backlight?: boolean;
     backlightColor?: string;
   }) {
     // ...
   }
   ```

1. Conditionally render the backlight element using the `backlight` prop.

   ```tsx filename="new-scene.tsx" {11}
   export function Untitled({
     backlight = true,
     backlightColor,
   }: {
     backlight?: boolean;
     backlightColor?: string;
   }) {
     return (
       <>
         ...
         {backlight && <pointLight name="Backlight" />}
       </>
     );
   }
   ```

1. Pass the `backlightColor` prop to the backlight point light.

   ```tsx filename="new-scene.tsx" {/color={backlightColor}/}
   export function Untitled({
     backlight = true,
     backlightColor,
   }: {
     backlight?: boolean;
     backlightColor?: string;
   }) {
     return (
       <>
         ...
         {backlight && <pointLight color={backlightColor} name="Backlight" />}
       </>
     );
   }
   ```

1. Click the <ActionLink icon={Pencil2Icon} href="/docs/building-your-scene/learn-the-ui/scene-panel#openclose-component-controls" name="Component Controls" /> action in the ScenePanel. The controls shown in the scene panel are the props the component accepts which can be changed as you build!

1. Toggle the `backlight` prop on and off, then set the `backlightColor` prop to a color you like. Red is always a great choice!

<KnowledgeCallout>
  Component controls let you change the props of the open component. Very useful
  when you want to see how your component behaves with props of different
  values!
