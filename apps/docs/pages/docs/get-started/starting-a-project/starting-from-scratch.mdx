title: Starting From Scratch
---

This guide walks you through the minimum amount of steps to open a component inside Triplex. If you haven't already make sure to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and initialize a new project with `npm init` and follow the prompts.

## Install Dependencies

This installs the required packages to your project and places them in its `package.json` file.

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm install @types/react @types/react-dom @types/three @react-three/fiber react react-dom three
```

## Create a Component

This can be anything you want, here we create a box.

```tsx filename="src/scene.tsx"
export default function Scene() {
  return (
    <mesh>
      <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
      <meshStandardMaterial color="red" />
    </mesh>
  );
}
```

## Open in Triplex

Continue building with either [Triplex for VS Code](/docs/get-started/vscode#opening-components) or [Triplex Standalone](/docs/get-started/standalone#opening-components).

## Common Questions

### Why is a tsconfig.json file created when opening a component?

The Scene Panel is populated by your component props sourced by the TypeScript compiler which needs this file.
