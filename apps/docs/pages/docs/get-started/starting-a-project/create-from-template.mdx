Creating a new project from a template is the fastest way to start developing your next scene with Triplex.

## Using the CLI

In a folder where your projects live run [create-triplex-project](/docs/api-reference/cli/create-triplex-project):

```bash filename="Terminal"
npx create-triplex-project@latest
```

When running you'll see the following prompts, if you're not sure what to choose press enter to accept the default.

```text filename="Terminal"
What should we call your project? my-triplex-project
What template would you like to use? basic
What package manager do you use? pnpm
Will initialize into a new folder, continue? Yes / No
Open project in Visual Studio Code? Yes / No
```

After answering the prompts your project will be created and dependencies installed using the package manager you chose.
