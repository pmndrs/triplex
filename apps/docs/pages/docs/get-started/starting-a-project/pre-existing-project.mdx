title: Pre-Existing Project
---

Your pre-existing React project can be used with Triplex without needing upfront configuration, however to have a complete experience some set up is needed if you're not using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Install Types

Component props are inferred by TypeScript and displayed in the [Scene Panel](/docs/building-your-scene/learn-the-ui/scene-panel) as controls. Installing these types enables host elements such as `mesh` and `group` to have their props available as controls.

```bash
npm install @types/react @types/three
```

## Common Questions

### Why does my component error when opened?

Triplex renders components in a isolated sandbox taking control of rendering the canvas and your component. If your component was not built to be self-contained it may error which is common with components that rely on [Context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) or global state.

To fix this you can:

- Refactor your component to be more self contained
- Use a [Provider Component](/docs/building-your-scene/project-config#provider-component) to provide the necessary context
- Set default props

### Why do my component props not show up in the Scene Panel?

If your project doesn't use TypeScript there is less type information available to populate the editor. You can get some inference for your components by declaring default props.

```tsx /color = "red"/ /x = 0/ /visible = true/
export function Component({ color = "red", x = 0, visible = true }) {
  return (
    <mesh visible={visible}>
      <meshBasicMaterial color={color} position={[x, 0, 0]} />
    </mesh>
  );
}
```

We recommend building with TypeScript for the best experience.

### Why is a tsconfig.json file created when opening a component?

The Scene Panel is populated by your component props sourced by the TypeScript compiler which needs this file.
