description: Keep building your existing project with Triplex.

Your pre-existing React project can be used with Triplex without needing upfront configuration, however to have a complete experience some set up is needed if you're not using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Install Types

Component props are inferred by TypeScript and displayed in the [Scene Panel](/docs/building-your-scene/learn-the-ui/scene-panel) as controls. Installing these types enables host elements such as `mesh` and `group` to have their props available as controls.

```bash
npm install @types/react @types/three
```

## Common Questions

### Are module aliases supported?

Yes. Aliases defined in your tsconfig.json are honored by Triplex. For example the following config lets you import modules from the src/components folder through the `@components/` module prefix.

```json filename="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "./src",
    "paths": {
      "@components/*": ["components/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

If you've used [Next.js module path aliases](https://nextjs.org/docs/14/app/building-your-application/configuring/absolute-imports-and-module-aliases) it's exactly the same.

### Why does my component error when opened?

Triplex renders components in a isolated sandbox taking control of rendering your component. If your component was not built to be self-contained it may error, common with components that rely on [Context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) or global state.

To fix this you could:

- Refactor your component to be self contained
- Use a [Global Provider](/docs/building-your-scene/global-provider) to provide the missing React context
- Declare the required Context / state inside another component and open that one instead
- Set default props

### Why do my component props not show up in the Scene Panel?

If your project doesn't use TypeScript there is less type information available to populate the editor. You can get some inference for your components by declaring default props.

```tsx /color = "red"/ /x = 0/ /visible = true/
export function Component({ color = "red", x = 0, visible = true }) {
  return (
    <mesh visible={visible}>
      <meshBasicMaterial color={color} position={[x, 0, 0]} />
    </mesh>
  );
}
```

We recommend building with TypeScript for the best experience.

### Why is a tsconfig.json file created when opening a component?

The Scene Panel is populated by your component props sourced by the TypeScript compiler which needs this file.
