## Installation

1. Visit the [Download page](/download)
2. Download the inferred installer for your operating system; or
3. Alternatively select a specific installer

For operating system specific steps see:

- [macOS](/docs/get-started/standalone/macos)

- [Linux](/docs/get-started/standalone/linux)

## Opening Components

### Using the Open Component action

Find the <ActionLink icon={DashboardIcon} href="/docs/building-your-scene/learn-the-ui/tab-bar" name="Open Component" /> action at the top left area of the user interface and click it to be presented a list of components to open.

### Excluding files

By default all React components can be opened by Triplex. When wanting to scope the files that can be opened you can create a [configuration file](/docs/api-reference/config-options) and populate the `"files"` field.

For example the following configuration marks all tsx files inside the components folder can be opened, anything else is excluded.

```json filename=".triplex/config.json"
{
  "files": ["../src/components/**/*.tsx"]
}
```

For more information see [config.json Options > files](/docs/api-reference/config-options/files).

## Common Questions

### How do I edit my source code?

Currently Triplex Standalone doesn't support editing source code directly. You'll need to use your favorite code editor to make changes to your project. Alternatively, you can use the [Triplex for VS Code](/docs/get-started/vscode) right inside Visual Studio Code.

### Why can't I open one of my components?

Only components that are exported can be opened in Triplex. If you're trying to open a component that isn't exported you'll need to export it first.

```diff
-function Component(): JSX.Element;
+export function Component(): JSX.Element;
```

### Why is there is a difference between Triplex for VS Code and Triplex Standalone?

Currently Triplex for VS Code has more active development and so has more features. This will change in the future.
