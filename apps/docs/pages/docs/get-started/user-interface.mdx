The editor is split into three quadrants.

1. The left panel is called the **scene panel**, it displays information about
   the component you have open.
2. The right panel is called the **context panel**, it displays information for
   things in context.
3. The floating row of buttons is called the **controls menu**, it displays
   actions for the scene such as transforms and zoom level.
