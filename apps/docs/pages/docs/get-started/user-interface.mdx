# User Interface

![Triplex UI](/triplex-ui.png)

The Triplex UI is split into three quadrants.

1. The left panel displays information about the open component, such as the
   name, links to source, available actions, and a list of elements.
2. The transform controls, which toggles the current transform mode such as
   transform, scale, and rotate.
3. The right panel displays information about the selected element, such as the
   name, links to source, available actions, and a list of available props.

## Left panel

The left panel displays information about the open component, such as the name,
links to source, available actions, and a list of elements.

### Actions

There are multiple actions available to perform against the open component.

#### Add component

![Add component action available in the left sidebar](/add-component-action.png)

Add both built-in elements and custom components to the open component using the
add action.

Custom components listed in the add components drawer are sourced from the
`components` glob in the config. [Learn more](/docs/api-reference/config) in the
config docs.

#### Exit component

![Exit a component in the left sidebar](/exit-component-action.png)

This action is shown after
[entering a component](/docs/basic-features/selection#enter-component) you're
able to exit it using the exit component action, returning you to the original
component.

### Elements list

![View elements in the currently opened component in the left sidebar](/elements-list.png)

This list contains all elements declared inside the open component. Note that
elements that are conditionally rendered will also show up here.

## Transform controls

![Available transforms in the transform panel](/transform-controls.png)

Change the current transform mode by selecting one of the transforms (translate,
rotate, scale) in this panel.

**Hotkeys**

- Translate `T`
- Rotate `R`
- Scale `S`

## Right panel

The right panel displays information about the selected element, such as the
name, links to source, available actions, and a list of available props.

### Actions

There are multiple actions available to perform against the selected element.

#### Enter component

![Enter the selected component in the right sidebar](/enter-selected-action.png)

Entering a component transitions the editor to the selected elements component,
all other components in the original scene will no-longer be rendered. When
transitioned all props that can be serialized will be passed along and set on
the entered component.

Currently React context is not forwarded, if your component relies on any and
throws when it's missing, it will throw when entering.

**Hotkeys**

- `Shift` + `F`

#### Focus camera

![Focus the selected component in the right sidebar](/focus-selected-action.png)

The focus camera action moves the camera to the selected element.

**Hotkeys**

- `F`

#### Delete

![Delete the selected component in the right sidebar](/delete-selected-action.png)

The delete action removes the selected element from the open component. If
accidental it can be undone using the undo action.

**Hotkeys**

- `Backspace`

### Element props

![Edit the selected components' props in the right sidebar](/props-list.png)

All supported props are shown here including props that are not yet declared on
the element. For props that take union types (multiple options) you're able to
switch between them using the switch prop type action next to the prop field.

For example this will show a color field with no switch prop type action:

```ts
interface Props {
  color: string;
}
```

This will show a select field with no switch prop type action:

```ts
interface Props {
  color: "red" | "yellow" | "blue";
}
```

And this will show an array field with a switch prop type action to switch
between union types:

```ts
interface Props {
  color: [number, number, number] | string;
}
```

## Menu bar

The menu bar contains actions you can perform against the open project.

### Opening a component

![Open a component in the file menu](/open-action.png)

Opening a component can be performed through the file menu `File` > `Open`. Both
default and named exports can be opened by Triplex.

Components listed in the open drawer are sourced from the `files` glob in the
config. [Learn more](/docs/api-reference/config) in the config docs.

### Creating a new file

![Create a file in the file menu](/new-file-action.png)

Creating a new file can be performed through the file menu `File` > `New File`.
Currently you're able to specify the component name which will be used as a
[named export](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export#using_named_exports).
On save you will be asked where to save the file to.

### Undo / Redo

![Undo and redo in the edit menu](/undo-action.png)

Undo and redo changes through the edit menu `Edit` > `Undo`. Changes made inside
the editor don't get persisted to source code until you save. Currently when
saving the undo/redo stack is cleared.

**Hotkeys**

- MacOS `Cmd` + `Z` / `Shift` + `Cmd` + `Z`
- Windows `Ctrl` + `Z` / `Shift` + `Ctrl` + `Z`

### Saving

![Save a file in the file menu](/save-action.png)

Saving your changes can be performed through the file menu `File` > `Save. This
will persist changes to the file system. When modifying source code directly
however any changes made in the editor will be thrown away, be careful!

**Hotkeys**

- MacOS `Cmd` + `S`
- Windows `Ctrl` + `S`

### Reset changes

![Reset your changes in the edit menu](/reset-action.png)

Clear changes you've made in the editor through the edit menu `Edit` > `Reset`.
This will throw away changes and reload the scene.
