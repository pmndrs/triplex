title: Triplex for VS Code
---

Triplex for VS Code turns [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) into a visual IDE, bringing the best features of Triplex for you to stay in context while coding.

## Installation

1. Visit the [Visual Studio Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=trytriplex.triplex-vsce)
2. Press the "Install" button
3. Make sure "Auto update" is checked

## Opening Components

### Using the CodeLens action

The `Open in Triplex` [CodeLens](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/02/12/code-lens-roundup) action appears next to component functions. Clicking it opens the component in Triplex.

### Using the Command Palette

While viewing a `tsx` or `jsx` file selecting the `Triplex: Open File` action in the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) will open the first found component in that file in Triplex.

### Excluding files

By default all React components can be opened by Triplex. When wanting to scope the files that can be opened you can create a `.triplex/config.json` file and populate the `"files"` field.

For example the following configuration marks all tsx files inside the components folder can be opened, anything else is excluded.

```json filename=".triplex/config.json"
{
  "files": ["../src/components/**/*.tsx"]
}
```

For more information see [config.json Options > files](/docs/api-reference/config-options/files).
