Triplex for VS Code turns [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com) and more into your visual workspace, bringing the best features of Triplex for you to stay in context while coding.

## Installation

1. Visit the [Visual Studio Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=trytriplex.triplex-vsce)
2. Press the "Install" button
3. Make sure "Auto Update" is checked

## Opening Components

### Using the CodeLens action

The <ActionLink name="Open in Triplex" href="#" /> [CodeLens](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/02/12/code-lens-roundup) action appears next to component functions. Clicking it opens the component in Triplex.

### Using the Command Palette

While focused in a `tsx` or `jsx` file selecting the <ActionLink name="Triplex: Open File" href="#" /> action through the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) will open the first found component of that file in Triplex.

### Excluding files

By default all React components can be opened by Triplex. When wanting to scope down files that can be opened you can create a [configuration file](/docs/api-reference/config-options) and populate the `"files"` field.

For example the following configuration marks all `tsx` files inside the components folder can be opened, everything else is excluded.

```json filename=".triplex/config.json"
{
  "files": ["../src/components/**/*.tsx"]
}
```

For more information see [config.json Options > files](/docs/api-reference/config-options/files).

## Common Questions

### Why is there a SharedArrayBuffer is not defined error?

Visual Studio Code by default doesn't run in a [secure context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts) which means certain APIs are unavailable, like SharedArrayBuffer. To enable these APIs you need to close all instances of Visual Studio Code and then re-open with the `--enable-coi` flag.

```bash filename="Terminal"
code --enable-coi
```

This flag was [introduced on September 2022 (version 1.72)](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_72#_towards-cross-origin-isolation).

### Why can't I open one of my components?

Only components that are exported can be opened in Triplex. If you're trying to open a component that isn't exported you'll need to export it first.

```diff
-function Component(): JSX.Element;
+export function Component(): JSX.Element;
```

### How do I reload the editor?

If there's a problem and the editor has been put into an invalid state you can reload the editor by accessing the command palette via <Kbd>Shift</Kbd> + <Kbd>Cmd</Kbd> + <Kbd>P</Kbd> then selecting "Developer: Reload Webviews".

If you think you've found a bug please [raise an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/trytriplex/triplex/issues/new).

### Why is Triplex slow?

You might have GPU acceleration disabled. To fix:

1. Press <Kbd>Cmd</Kbd> + <Kbd>Shift</Kbd> + <Kbd>P</Kbd>
2. Search for "Preferences: Configure Runtime Arguments"
3. Add the following line of code:
   ```json
   "disable-hardware-acceleration": false
   ```
