description: Turn Visual Studio Code into a visual IDE.
---

Triplex for VS Code turns [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) into a visual IDE, bringing the best features of Triplex for you to stay in context while coding.

## Installation

1. Visit the [Visual Studio Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=trytriplex.triplex-vsce)
2. Press the "Install" button
3. Make sure "Auto update" is checked

## Opening Components

### Using the CodeLens action

The <ActionLink name="Open in Triplex" href="/docs" /> [CodeLens](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/02/12/code-lens-roundup) action appears next to component functions. Clicking it opens the component in Triplex.

### Using the Command Palette

While viewing a `tsx` or `jsx` file selecting the <ActionLink name="Triplex: Open File" href="/docs" /> action in the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) will open the first found component in that file in Triplex.

### Excluding files

By default all React components can be opened by Triplex. When wanting to scope the files that can be opened you can create a [configuration file](/docs/api-reference/config-options) and populate the `"files"` field.

For example the following configuration marks all tsx files inside the components folder can be opened, anything else is excluded.

```json filename=".triplex/config.json"
{
  "files": ["../src/components/**/*.tsx"]
}
```

For more information see [config.json Options > files](/docs/api-reference/config-options/files).

## Common Questions

### I'm getting a SharedArrayBuffer is not defined error

Visual Studio Code by default doesn't run in a [secure context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts) which means certain APIs are unavailable, like SharedArrayBuffer. To enable these APIs you need to close all instances of Visual Studio Code and then re-open with the `--enable-coi` flag.

This flag was [introduced on September 2022 (version 1.72)](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_72#_towards-cross-origin-isolation).
