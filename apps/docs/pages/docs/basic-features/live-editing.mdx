# Live Editing

Triplex two-way syncs between the editor and your source code. Making changes
inside the editor and saving will update the source file, likewise editing the
source code and saving will update the editor.

## Opening a Component

![Open a component in the file menu](/open-action.png)

Opening a component can be performed through the file menu `File` > `Open`. Both
default and named exports can be opened by Triplex.

Components listed in the open drawer are sourced from the `files` glob in the
config. [Learn more](/docs/api-reference/config) in the config docs.

## Creating a New File

![Create a file in the file menu](/new-file-action.png)

Creating a new file can be performed through the file menu `File` > `New File`.
Currently you're able to specify the component name which will be used as a
[named export](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export#using_named_exports).
On save you will be asked where to save the file to.

## Undo / Redo

![Undo and redo in the edit menu](/undo-action.png)

Undo and redo changes through the edit menu `Edit` > `Undo`. Changes made inside
the editor don't get persisted to source code until you save. Currently when
saving the undo/redo stack is cleared.

**Hotkeys**

- MacOS `Cmd` + `Z` / `Shift` + `Cmd` + `Z`
- Windows `Ctrl` + `Z` / `Shift` + `Ctrl` + `Z`

## Saving

![Save a file in the file menu](/save-action.png)

Saving your changes can be performed through the file menu `File` > `Save. This
will persist changes to the file system. When modifying source code directly
however any changes made in the editor will be thrown away, be careful!

**Hotkeys**

- MacOS `Cmd` + `S`
- Windows `Ctrl` + `S`

## Reset Changes

![Reset your changes in the edit menu](/undo-action.png)

Clear changes you've made in the editor through the edit menu `Edit` > `Reset`.
This will throw away changes and reload the scene.

rotate, scale) in this panel.
