import { CaretDownIcon, CaretRightIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";

When opening a component in Triplex its elements are displayed in the Scene Panel. These elements can have their props inspected and edited through the [UI controls](/docs/building-your-scene/components/editing-props) and [Scene](/docs/building-your-scene/scene/transform-controls).

Elements can be both host elements such as `mesh` and `group`, and custom components such as `YourPrefabComponent` and `PerspectiveCamera`. To tell them apart host elements always start with a lowercase letter where as custom components start with an uppercase letter.

## Inspecting Custom Components

Clicking on the <ActionLink name="View Child Elements" href="/" icon={CaretRightIcon} /> action on a custom component will reveal that components elements. You're able to inspect and edit them just as you can elements owned by the open component.

Editing the elements will modify that component in its file when saving.

<KnowledgeCallout>
  Custom components that are sourced from node modules cannot be inspected or
  edited.

## Switching Between Components

You can switch between the components declared in a file by using the <ActionLink name="Component Switcher" icon={CaretDownIcon} href="/" /> at the top of the Scene Panel.

<KnowledgeCallout>
  Switching components will not lose any changes you've made. Triplex will keep
  all the changes you've made until you save or close the file.
