import { CaretDownIcon, CaretRightIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";

When opening a component in Triplex its elements are displayed in the Scene Panel. These elements can have their props inspected and edited through the [UI controls](/docs/building-your-scene/components/editing-props) and [Scene](/docs/building-your-scene/scene/transform-controls).

Elements can be both host elements such as `mesh` and `group`, and custom components such as `YourPrefabComponent` and `PerspectiveCamera`. To tell them apart host elements always start with a lowercase letter where as custom components start with an uppercase letter.

<KnowledgeCallout>
  If you find elements of the same name being hard to differentiate setting a
  `name` prop on them will be reflected in the Scene Panel.
</KnowledgeCallout>

## Inspecting Custom Components

Clicking on the <ActionLink name="View Child Elements" href="/docs/building-your-scene/learn-the-ui/scene-panel#showhide-child-elements" icon={CaretRightIcon} /> action on a custom component will reveal that components elements. You're able to inspect and edit them just as you can elements owned by the open component.

Editing the elements will modify that component in its file when saving.

<KnowledgeCallout>
  Custom components that are sourced from node modules cannot be inspected or
  edited.
</KnowledgeCallout>

## Switching Between Components

You can switch between the components declared in a file by using the <ActionLink name="Component Switcher" icon={CaretDownIcon} href="/docs/building-your-scene/learn-the-ui/scene-panel#component-switcher" /> at the top of the Scene Panel.

<KnowledgeCallout>
  Switching components will not lose any changes you've made. Triplex will keep
  all the changes you've made until you save or close the file.
</KnowledgeCallout>

## Naming Elements

Elements that appear in the Scene Panel can be given a name by setting the `name` prop. This name will be reflected in the Scene Panel and can be used to identify elements that are hard to differentiate.

For example given the following code:

```tsx
export function Scene() {
  return (
    <>
      <mesh name="box1">
        <boxGeometry />
      </mesh>
      <mesh name="box2">
        <boxGeometry />
      </mesh>
    </>
  );
}
```

The elements will be rendered in the Scene Panel as "box1 (mesh)" and "box2 (mesh)".

<KnowledgeCallout>
  Both host elements and custom components can be named, however the value
  passed to the name prop must be a string literal for it to be reflected in the
  Scene Panel.
</KnowledgeCallout>
