import { CaretDownIcon, CaretRightIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";

When opening a component in Triplex its elements are displayed in the Scene Panel. These elements can have their props inspected and edited through [UI controls](/docs/building-your-scene/components/editing-props) and in the [Scene](/docs/building-your-scene/scene/transform-controls).

Elements can be both host elements such as `mesh` and `div`, and custom components such as `YourPrefabComponent` and `Button`.

To tell them apart host elements always start with a lowercase letter where as custom components start with an uppercase letter.

<KnowledgeCallout>
  If you find elements of the same name being hard to differentiate setting a
  `name` prop on them will be reflected in the Scene Panel.

## Element Actions

Each element has available actions you can perform on it:

- Delete — <Kbd>Backspace</Kbd>
- Duplicate — <Kbd>Cmd</Kbd> + <Kbd>D</Kbd>
- Zoom To Element — <Kbd>F</Kbd>
- Go To Declaration

In Triplex for VS Code you can find these actions in the right-click menu on an element.

## Inspecting Custom Components

Clicking on the <ActionLink name="View Child Elements" href="/docs/building-your-scene/learn-the-ui/scene-panel#showhide-child-elements" icon={CaretRightIcon} /> action on a custom component will reveal its internally rendered elements. You're able to inspect and edit them just as you can elements owned by the open component.

<KnowledgeCallout>
  Custom components that are sourced from node modules can also be edited and
  inspected.
</KnowledgeCallout>

## Switching Between Components

You can switch between the components declared in a file by using the <ActionLink name="Component Switcher" icon={CaretDownIcon} href="/docs/building-your-scene/learn-the-ui/scene-panel#component-switcher" /> at the top of the Scene Panel.

<KnowledgeCallout>
  Switching components will not lose any changes you've made as Triplex keeps
  all the changes you've made until you save or close the file.
</KnowledgeCallout>

## Naming Elements

Elements that appear in the Scene Panel can be given a name by setting the `name` prop. This name will be reflected in the Scene Panel and can be used to identify elements that are hard to differentiate.

For example given the following code:

```tsx
export function Scene() {
  return (
    <>
      <mesh name="box1">
        <boxGeometry />
      </mesh>
      <mesh name="box2">
        <boxGeometry />
      </mesh>
    </>
  );
}
```

The elements will be rendered in the Scene Panel as "box1 (mesh)" and "box2 (mesh)".

<KnowledgeCallout>
  Both host elements and custom components can be named, however the value
  passed to the name prop must be a static string literal for it to be reflected
  in the Scene Panel.
</KnowledgeCallout>
