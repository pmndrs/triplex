description: Learn how Triplex supports code-first development.

Not all scenes and behavior can be created visually either for technical or taste reasons, however Triplex still works great with a code-first workflow.

## Two-Way Sync

Triplex doesn't just save your changes back to source, it's also immediately synchronized from changes made to your source files outside of Triplex. This enables you to iterate in code and see the results in the Scene, and if you're using [Triplex for VS Code](/docs/get-started/vscode) you don't even have to leave your IDE!

<KnowledgeCallout>
  Using Triplex as a code-first workflow feels very similar to using
  [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) but with the added benefit of its
  inspection / productivity features and dependencies being handled for you.

## The Ecosystem Bundler

Triplex runs your code using [Vite](https://vite.dev/) a popular build tool for the web, along with out-of-the-box features like [Hot Module Replacement](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement) and [React Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

This means you get a fast, responsive development environment without having to do the work to get it set up, nor maintain it over time.

## Managed Dependencies

Unlike traditional development tools installed through node modules, Triplex isn't installed into your repository but instead is a [standalone app](/docs/get-started/standalone) and [VS Code extension](/docs/get-started-vscode). This means you don't have to worry about managing dependencies and you can use the latest features without waiting for your team or repository to upgrade.

Here are common scenarios that are no longer an issue:

- Duplicate dependencies causing unexpected errors
- Dependency bloat causing install times to increase
- Upgrade friction/pain from upgrading through major versions
- Transitive dependency versions blocking upgrades
- Dependencies needing interventions because of security violations

<KnowledgeCallout>
  While Triplex manages its own dependencies it still uses your dependencies
  where appropriate. Anything you import along with environment dependencies
  such as `react` and `react-dom` are sourced from your project.
