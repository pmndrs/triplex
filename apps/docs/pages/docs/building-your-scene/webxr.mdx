## Enabling the Feature

Triplex WebXR is an experimental feature in active development. To enable it you need to turn on the feature gate inside your [Triplex config](/docs/api-reference/config-options):

```json {2-4} filename=".triplex/config.json"
{
  "experimental": {
    "xr_editing": true
  }
}
```

  The renderer code for Triplex WebXR is open source and [available on
  GitHub](https://github.com/trytriplex/triplex/tree/main/packages/renderer/src/features/webxr).
  Contributions are welcome! If you want to help us improve the WebXR
  experience, please check out the code and open a pull request.

## Get Started

Open your 3D component by clicking the <ActionLink icon={VRGogglesIcon} name="Open in WebXR" /> action in the floating controls. If you don't have the `@react-three/xr` package installed you'll be prompted to install it.

When ready there are three options to view your scene through WebXR:

1. Send to Meta Quest — The WebXR scene gets sent to your Meta Quest headset.
2. Open in Browser Emulator — For testing purposes, you can view the scene in a browser emulator that simulates a WebXR environment.
3. Copy WebXR Link — The link that is sent to your headset, copy it to another device to view the scene in WebXR.

## Available Controls

When inside Triplex WebXR you can use the left controller to move around the scene, and the right controller to interact and transform elements.

- <Kbd>Right Trigger</Kbd> — Select / deselect an object.
- <Kbd>A Button</Kbd> — Cycle through the transform modes (translate, rotate,
  scale).
- <Kbd>B Button</Kbd> — Cycle through transform spaces (local, world).

Any changes made through Triplex WebXR get synced back to the owning Triplex editor. To undo / redo / save changes you'll need to use the owning Triplex editor.

## Common Questions

### Why is there a certificate warning when opening the WebXR scene?

WebXR requires a secure context, which means the page must be served over HTTPS. When running Triplex WebXR it uses a self-signed certificate and as such you can safely ignore this warning for local development purposes.
