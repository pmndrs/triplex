description: Learn how components are the foundation of Triplex.
---

Components are the [building blocks of the React ecosystem](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component) and the primary way to build out your scene. React Three Fiber saw an explosion of ecosystem growth thanks to components / [Drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei) so embracing this model in Triplex was foundational.

## Sandbox Isolation

Components opened inside Triplex are open inside an isolated sandbox environment, meaning if they rely on some global state or context you'll either need to declare the environment using [Provider Controls](/docs/building-your-scene/provider-controls) or replace usage with props.
