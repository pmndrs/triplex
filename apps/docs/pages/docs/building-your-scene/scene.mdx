description: The scene is where you build and interact with your components.

Components are rendered by themselves alongside visual controls. This means if your components rely on global state or context there may be some work involved to get it rendering without an error.

- Refactor your component to be self contained
- Use a [provider component](/docs/building-your-scene/providers) to provide the missing React context
- Declare the required context or state in another component and open that instead
- Set default props
