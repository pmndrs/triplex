The Scene is responsible for rendering the development environment where you build and interact with your components.

## Sandbox Isolation

Your components are rendered in an isolated sandbox environment alongside tools such as Transform Controls. This means if your components rely on global state or context there is some work involved to get it rendering.

- Refactor your component to be more self contained
- Use a [Provider Component](/docs/building-your-scene/project-config#provider-component) to provide the necessary context
- Declare the environment inside another component and open that instead
- Set default props
