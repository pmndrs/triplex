## Enabling the Feature

The debug panel is an experimental feature. To enable it you need to turn on the feature gate inside your [Triplex config](/docs/api-reference/config-options):

```json {2-4} filename=".triplex/config.json"
{
  "experimental": {
    "debug_api": true
  }
}
```

## Installation

To get types for the debug panel you need to install a package then update your `tsconfig.json` / `jsconfig.json` to inject global Triplex types.

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm i @triplex/api
```

```json {3} filename="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["@triplex/api/types"]
  }
}
```
