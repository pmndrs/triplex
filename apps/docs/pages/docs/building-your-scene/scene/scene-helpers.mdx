description: Scene Helpers let you inspect and debug your scene.
---

Some scene objects don't have a visual representation and by default are invisible, Scene Helpers let you see where they are along with other useful features without having to write code for it.

Scene helpers are hidden when in play mode, see [Play Controls](/docs/building-your-scene/scene/play-controls) for more information.
