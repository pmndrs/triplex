description: Scene Helpers let you see where invisible objects are such as cameras and lights.

Some scene objects don't have a visual representation and by default are invisible, Scene Helpers let you see where they are along with other useful features without having to write code for it.

Scene helpers are hidden in the Scene when in play mode, see [Play Controls](/docs/building-your-scene/scene/play-controls) for more information.
