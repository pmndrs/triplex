This helper is only available in 3D components.

## Camera Preview

When a camera is selected a preview is shown in the Scene.

## Camera Controls

The editor camera can be controlled using the following keyboard and mouse shortcuts.

- Rotate the camera — <Kbd>Left Click</Kbd>
- Dolly the camera — <Kbd>Middle Click</Kbd>
- Truck the camera — <Kbd>Shift</Kbd> + <Kbd>Left Click</Kbd>; or <Kbd>Right Click</Kbd>
- Focus on a selected object — <Kbd>F</Kbd>

Use the <ActionLink name="Switch To Orthographic" icon={GridIcon} /> action in the floating scene controls to set the editor camera to be orthographic. Use the <ActionLink name="Switch To Perspective" icon={PerspectiveGridIcon} /> action to switch back to perspective.

## Camera Settings

Found in the floating scene controls menu, you can use the camera settings to change which camera is active.

- Use Default Camera — Sets the camera to look through the default camera.
- Use Editor Camera (default: true) — Sets the camera to look through the editor camera.
- Toggle Editor As Default (default: false) — Sets the editor camera to be the default camera for the scene state, meaning `useThree(state => state.camera)` will return the editor camera.

## Camera Axis Helper

The camera axis helper can be used to orient the camera to a selected axis. Interacting with an axis will rotate and zoom the camera to that view, for example clicking on "Y" will rotate and zoom the top of your scene into view.
