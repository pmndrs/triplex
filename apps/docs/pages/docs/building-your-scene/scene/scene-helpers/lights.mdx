## Default Lights

If there are no lights in your scene default lights will be rendered so it can be illuminated which is especially useful when your components are open in isolation.

To turn off the default lights click the <ActionLink icon={SunIcon} href="/docs/building-your-scene/learn-the-ui/scene#turn-onoff-default-lights" name="Turn Off Default Lights" /> action in the Scene Controls.

Default lights are turned on if needed when your scene is initially rendered. When [resetting your scene](/docs/building-your-scene/scene/play-controls#resetting-the-scene) this also resets the lights back to their initial state, on if needed otherwise off.
