import { EnterFullScreenIcon, ExitFullScreenIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";

When working with your scene testing across different viewport sizes and aspect ratios is a common need. Frame Controls let you quickly change the size of the frame to match different viewport sizes.

Supported sizes are:

- Square
- Mobile
- Tablet
- Desktop

## Accessing Frame Controls

To access Frame Controls click on the <ActionLink href="/docs/building-your-scene/learn-the-ui/scene-panel#collapse-to-frame" name="Collapse To Frame" icon={ExitFullScreenIcon} /> action in the Scene Panel. The Scene will be collapsed down to a fixed size and new actions will appear in the Scene Controls to control the zoom of the frame. Click & drag to move the frame around.

## Exiting Frame Controls

Once you're finished click the <ActionLink href="/docs/building-your-scene/learn-the-ui/scene#expand-frame" name="Expand Frame" icon={EnterFullScreenIcon} /> action to exit.
