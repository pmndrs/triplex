description: Component controls let you change the props that are given to your component.

import { EraserIcon, Pencil2Icon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";

Seeing how your component behaves when given different props is a key part of building with Triplex. Change the props of your component at any time by clicking the <ActionLink icon={Pencil2Icon} name="Component Controls" /> action in the scene panel.

## Making Changes

With the controls open you can change the value of props through the UI. The behavior is the same as [Input Controls](/docs/building-your-scene/scene/input-controls) with one difference â€” changes are only temporary for the current session.

For more advanced and specific scenarios we recommend creating example components with props needed.

## Resetting Changes

To reset props back to their default values click the <ActionLink icon={EraserIcon} name="Reset Props" /> action.

  Props that have [default values](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#specifying-a-default-value-for-a-prop) set through destructured args are respected by Component Controls, including when resetting props back to their default values.

```tsx /x = 10/
export function Component({ x = 10 }: { x: number });
```

## Alternative to Leva

Writing code with [Leva](https://github.com/pmndrs/leva) is a common way to have your component be configurable during development. With component controls you're able to decide if you want to maintain that code or not.

See the [Replacing Leva With Component Props](/resources/replacing-leva-with-props) guide for how to use Triplex like Leva.
