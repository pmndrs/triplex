description: Select elements by interacting with scene objects in the Scene.

import { PlayIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";

The selection system prioritizes components. When you click on a scene object if it belongs to a component the component element will be selected, otherwise the host element will be.

## Selection Cycling

Clicking multiple times on a scene object will cycle through all the elements that are under the cursor, even HTML ones! This is useful when you have multiple elements stacked on top of each other.

## Hidden Scene Objects

To select scene objects that don't render anything into the scene such as a `group`, `Fragment`, or invisible objects you can use the Scene Panel to select them.
