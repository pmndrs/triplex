description: Select elements by interacting with scene objects in the Scene.

import { PlayIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons";

The selection system prioritizes components. When you click on a scene object if it belongs to a component the component element will be selected, otherwise the host element will be.

## Selection Cycling

Clicking multiple times on a scene object will cycle through all the elements that are under the cursor. This is useful when you have multiple elements stacked on top of each other.

## Hidden Scene Objects

To select hidden scene objects such as `group` or elements that are invisible you can use the Scene Panel to select them.

## Interaction Events

Your scene objects have all in-built raycasting events like `onClick`, and `onPointerOver` disabled when in the editor.

To test your scenes interactivity click the <ActionLink icon={PlayIcon} href="/docs" name="Play" /> action in the Scene Controls. See [Play Controls](/docs/building-your-scene/scene/play-controls) for more information.
