It's quick and easy to get up and running with Triplex. With a small download
it'll only take you a few minutes.

## Cross Platform

Triplex runs on macOS and Windows operating systems, follow the guides below:

- [macOS](/docs/setup/macos)
- [Windows](/docs/setup/windows)

## Update Cadence

Triplex is currently in rapid development, expect new versions often. When
starting the app it checks for new versions and if one is available will be
installed after exiting.
