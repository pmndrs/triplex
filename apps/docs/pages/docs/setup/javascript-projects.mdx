Triplex works best with TypeScript as the rich type information is used to
populate the editor controls, however if you're not yet using TypeScript you're
still able to use Triplex.

## Set up config file

In your existing project add a
[`.triplex/config.json`](/docs/api-reference/config) file:

```json
{
  "components": ["../src/components/**/*.jsx"],
  "files": ["../src/**/*.jsx"]
}
```

Where `"components"` is a glob pointing to custom components that can be added
to other components, and `"files"` is a glob pointing to any files you want to
open with Triplex.

## Add type packages

Make sure to add types to your project (even if you're not using TypeScript!) â€”
this will make your experience in Triplex that much better as all Three.js
primitives will have types the editor can use:

```
npm install @types/react @types/three
```

## Open your project

You're now able to open your project with Triplex! When you do Triplex will add
a `.tsconfig.json` file to the root of your project.
