# Triplex FAQ

## What version of React does Triplex use?

Triplex uses _your_ React versions, not its own, even when running Triplex as a
native app! That means it stays up-to-date with your code and you choose when to
upgrade. This is also the case for React Three Fiber and Three.js.

## What bundlers does Triplex support?

Triplex works with any bundler by not using your bundler at all. It uses Vite
internally when running the editor.

## Can I use Triplex with other frameworks?

Yes. Triplex operates on source code just as other frameworks do, you can use
the same code across multiple frameworks like Next.js or Remix. If you've used
Storybook or another similar devtool it's exactly the same.

## Why does my component error when trying to access React context?

Currently Triplex doesn't have a good story for setting React context when
opening leaf node components in the editor. This will be resolved in the future.

## Why do Triplex projects need TypeScript?

Triplex uses the TypeScript compiler to infer what props are available on
components, without it the usefulness of this feature is severely diminished.

## Does Triplex support monorepos?

Yes. You can either install it in your root directory or in a specific package.
There will be some rough edges, let us know when you find any.
