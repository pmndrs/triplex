## What version of React does Triplex use?

Triplex uses _your_ React, React Three Fiber, and Three.js installed packages,
not its own. That means it stays up-to-date with your code and you choose when
to upgrade.

## What bundlers does Triplex support?

Triplex works with any bundler by not using your bundler at all.

## Can I use Triplex with other frameworks?

Yes. Triplex operates on source code just as other frameworks do, you can use
the same code across multiple frameworks like Next.js or Remix.

## Why do Triplex projects need TypeScript?

Triplex uses the TypeScript compiler to infer what props are available on
components, without it the usefulness of this feature is severely diminished.

## Does Triplex support monorepos?

Yes. You can either install it in your root directory or in a specific package.
There will be some rough edges, let us know when you find any.
