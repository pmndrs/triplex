â–µ Triplex 0.58.0 improves on the provider component, changes how the refresh
scene command works, and fixes some bugs.

Thank you to Matt Black for sponsoring Triplex!

## Provider component props

Props declared on your provider component now appear as editable in the Triplex
UI, using the same powerful system used to edit components.

```diff
export default function Provider({
  children,
+  enablePhysics = false,
+  debugPhysics = false,
}: {
  children: ReactNode;
+  enablePhysics?: boolean;
+  debugPhysics?: boolean;
}) {
  return (
    <Context.Provider value>
      <Physics paused={!enablePhysics} debug={debugPhysics}>
        {children}
      </Physics>
    </Context.Provider>
  );
}
```

Here's some ideas where you could start using this feature:

- Declare a string literal union and switch between different environments from
  `@react-three/drei`
- Physics/post processing/XR helpers
- Entity Component System helpers to start and stop systems

## Refresh scene command

Previously using the refresh scene command (CMD+R) would perform a hard refresh
of the scene. Now this command has been renamed to reload scene (CMD+SHIFT+R)
and a soft refresh has taken its placed (CMD+R) that remounts the scene.

## Bug fixes

- Changes made to a provider component now are flushed through the editor rather
  than needing to restart it.
- Components sourced from node modules now can be flagged as transformed.
- Modified marker is now reset when changes originating from the file system
  occur.
- Default export module names are now inferred correctly when called in a
  function.
- Upsert prop action no longer shifts sibling elements line numbers if the prop
  value was smaller than the current value.
