▵ Triplex 0.56.0 introduces developer experience improvements and fixes some
bugs.

## Live edit props

Edit props given to the component you have open to test it in out over different
states. Changed props only last during your session however — so when you close
Triplex they're gone!

## Number input improvements

The number input has been improved with slider and increment/decrement behavior.
Use keyboard modifiers (shift/ctrl) to control how fine grained it should be!

## Set constraints with prop description tags

Declare JSDoc tags in your prop descriptions and Triplex will use them where
supported.

The first supported tags are `@max` and `@min` used in the number input, they
constrain what values are allowed to be set.

```js
interface CameraEntityProps {
  /**
   * @min -3
   * @max 1
   */
  offsetX?: number;
}
```

## Adding GLTF assets to your scene

GLTF is a common asset exported from 3D software like Blender. Now you can add
them to your components straight through Triplex without needing to write out
the code for it.

## Set host element names

Host elements such as mesh can now be labelled using the name prop. When set
they are used as the name shown in the scene panel.

## Union type input fixes

Previously props that were a union type, such as one that takes a number and a
string, would lose the ability switch between them in the context panel when the
prop was set with a value. This is now fixed.

## Other bug fixes

- All `undefined` values are now preserved when saving props instead of being
  set to `null`.
- Color inputs can now be cleared when not required.
- Tuple inputs no longer fire change events when required values are only
  partially filled.
