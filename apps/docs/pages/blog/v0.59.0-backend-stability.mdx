â–µ Triplex 0.59 completes a large refactor of the backend to improve scene
stability, fixing bugs, enabling new features, and setting us up for success
into the future.

## New features

- Exit selection command can now be triggered using the `Shift+CmdOrControl+F`
  hotkey
- Transform actions (translate/rotate/scale) are now available in the selection
  menu
- Triplex now warns you when the file you have open is outside where your
  project has defined files should be
  [[#135](https://github.com/try-triplex/triplex/issues/135)]

## Bug fixes

- Union literal labels are now shown in the select input when possible
  [[#87](https://github.com/try-triplex/triplex/issues/87)]
- Saving no longer accidentally triggers the scale transform mode
  [[#145](https://github.com/try-triplex/triplex/issues/145)]
- Changes to your scene are no longer visually lost when entering / exiting /
  reloading components [[#3](https://github.com/try-triplex/triplex/issues/3),
  [#53](https://github.com/try-triplex/triplex/issues/53)]
- Adding a new element then saving no longer results in the component briefly
  being unmounted [[#48](https://github.com/try-triplex/triplex/issues/48)]

## Chores

- When loading a project if it fails to load an error screen is now shown
  instead of nothing
- A loading screen is now shown when opening Triplex
  [[#31](https://github.com/try-triplex/triplex/issues/31)]
