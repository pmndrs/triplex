▵ Triplex 0.57.0 brings much needed quality of life improvements.

## Edit any child element in the scene panel

Previously only elements that were declared in the open component could be
edited, now any child element in the component tree can be edited and saved back
to source code.

## Filter components, elements, and props

Scrolling through large lists of components, elements, and props has been
cumbersome for everyone. Now you can filter through them and find exactly what
you're looking for.

## Declare a global React provider

For those who are heavy users of
[React Context](https://react.dev/reference/react/createContext#provider) you
can now declare a global provider component, opening the door to more advanced
use cases.

```js
// .triplex/provider.ts
import { XR } from "@react-three/xr";

export default function Provider({ children }) {
  return <XR>{children}</XR>;
}
```

```diff
// .triplex/config.json
{
+  "provider": "./provider.ts"
}
```

## Contextually add elements to a component

Adding an element to a component was confusing, depending if you had an element
selected or not you'd end up with unexpected behavior. Now it's contextual, the
add button in the actions list adds to the root of the component and the add
button on elements adds as a child.
