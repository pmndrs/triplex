▵ Triplex 0.60.0 introduces a new duplicate element action, improves element
actions overall user experience, and fixes some bugs.

## New features

- Flesh out a scene faster now by duplicating elements using the
  `CommandOrControl+D` hotkey
  [[#117](https://github.com/try-triplex/triplex/issues/117)]
- Element actions have moved from the context panel to the scene panel
- Enter selection has moved from an action button to a gesture — now double
  click on the element you want to navigate to instead

## Bug fixes

- Fix regression on Windows where the scene would never load
  [[#151](https://github.com/try-triplex/triplex/issues/151)]
- Inputs across Triplex can now have copy / paste commands executed on them via
  the standard hotkeys
  [[#143](https://github.com/try-triplex/triplex/issues/143)]
- Context panel now closes when the element has been lost. This could happen
  from being deleted in code, re-ordering, anything
  [[#56](https://github.com/try-triplex/triplex/issues/56)]
- When focusing inputs you will no longer trigger unexpected hotkeys such as
  transform mode changes when typing.
- IDE links now opened through the `launch-editor` package
  [[#142](https://github.com/try-triplex/triplex/issues/142)]
- Error overlay no longer closers after an HMR event
- Fix delete action not working on nested child elements
- Fix adding custom components to a new file

## Chores

- [End-to-end tests](https://twitter.com/_douges/status/1718741907315269963) now

  production again
