description: Your components might expect global styles to be available to render correctly. Here's how to set up Tailwind CSS in your Triplex project.
---

You can use the [Tailwind PostCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-postcss) set up with Triplex.

1. Install Tailwind CSS.

   ```bash filename="Terminal"
   npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss
   ```

1. Add Tailwind to your PostCSS configuration.

   ```js filename="postcss.config.mjs"
   export default {
     plugins: {
       "@tailwindcss/postcss": {},
     },
   };
   ```

1. Import Tailwind in your CSS file.

   ```css filename="styles.css"
   @import "tailwindcss";
   ```

1. Import the CSS file in your provider module.

   ```tsx filename=".triplex/provider.tsx"
   import "./styles.css";
   ```

1. Add the provider to your Triplex config. You'll need to restart Triplex after making this change.

   ```json filename=".triplex/config.json"
   {
     "provider": "./provider.tsx"
   }
   ```
