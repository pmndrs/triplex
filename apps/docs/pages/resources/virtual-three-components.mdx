title: Using Transform Controls With Virtual Scene Components
description: For use cases where transform controls would be a huge time saver but your 3D component doesn't render anything to the scene â€” you're still in luck.

## Virtual Scene Component

A virtual scene component in this context is one that takes transform props like `position` or `rotation` but doesn't use them in the scene, instead using them somewhere else.

Traditionally applying transform props looks like this:

```tsx {7}
export function Box({
  position,
}: {
  position: [x: number, y: number, z: number];
}) {
  return (
    <mesh position={position}>
      <boxGeometry />
    </mesh>
  );
}
```

The `position` prop is passed to the `mesh` element where it's used in the scene.

A virtual scene component on the other hand doesn't pass transform props to a scene object, instead using it somewhere else:

```tsx {6-8}
export function MyVirtualSceneComponent({
  position,
}: {
  position: [x: number, y: number, z: number];
}) {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Do something with the position prop
  }, [position]);

  return null;
}
```

## Using Transform Controls

To have transform controls work with virtual scene components you need to render something to the scene, even if it's not used:

```tsx {10}
export function MyVirtualSceneComponent({
  position,
}: {
  position: [x: number, y: number, z: number];
}) {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Do something with the position prop
  }, [position]);

  return <group />;
}
```

Transform controls will now be enabled for the transform mode selected. Remember the mode is only enabled if the component [takes the corresponding transform prop](/docs/building-your-scene/scene/visual-controls#transform-controls).

Don't want the transform controls to be affected by parent object transforms? Render an object through a portal:

```tsx {8,14}
import { createPortal, useThree } from "@react-three/fiber";

export function MyVirtualSceneComponent({
  position,
}: {
  position: [x: number, y: number, z: number];
}) {
  const scene = useThree((state) => state.scene);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Do something with the position prop
  }, [position]);

  return createPortal(<group />, scene);
}
```
