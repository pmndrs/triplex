## Host Elements

Host elements are the basic building blocks, like `<div>` in 2D components or `<mesh>` in 3D components. They can be given props to change their appearance and behavior.

If you're missing props for a host element make sure to try the following:

- Install missing packages, for example `three` needs `@types/three` installed.
- For custom elements, make sure the element has been registered correctly.

### React Three Fiber

Extend the `ThreeElements` interface, where `customElement` is your custom element name:

```tsx
import { extend, type ThreeElement } from "@react-three/fiber";
import { GridHelper } from "three";

class CustomElement extends GridHelper {}

// Extend so the reconciler will learn about it
extend({ CustomElement });

declare module "@react-three/fiber" {
  interface ThreeElements {
    customElement: ThreeElement<typeof CustomElement>;
  }
}
```

Learn more on at the [React Three Fiber documentation](https://r3f.docs.pmnd.rs/api/typescript).

## Custom Components

Custom components can have their props inferred even if they don't have a type definition, but it is limited and will only get you so far.

For the best experience make sure to use TypeScript and define props on your component:

```tsx
export function MyCustomComponent({ color }: { color?: string }) {
  return <div style={{ color }} />;
}
```

If you think your component should have props but they are not showing up even after following the above you may have found a bug. Please raise an issue at the [Triplex repository](https://github.com/trytriplex/triplex/issues).
