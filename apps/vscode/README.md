Triplex for VS Code is in development and released as **BETA**, there will be bugs and friction points. Make sure to join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nBzRBUEs4b) for support and to give feedback.

# Setup

By default all React components can be opened by Triplex. When wanting to scope it down you can create a `.triplex/config.json` file and populate the `"files"` field.

Learn more in the [project settings documentation](https://triplex.dev/docs/api-reference/config-options).
