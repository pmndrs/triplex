# Contributing to Triplex

Thank you for considering a contribution to Triplex! Pull requests, issues and comments are welcome. This is an open core repository meaning only a subset of the Triplex code is available. Currently only the scene renderer and related packages are open source. We will explore open sourcing more code in the future.

If you're looking for an issue to work on have a look at the "[**Contribution ready**](https://github.com/trytriplex/triplex/labels/Contribution%20ready)" labelled issues or reach out on the [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/nBzRBUEs4b).

## Set Up

1. Triplex uses [Volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started) and [corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) for managing Node.js and package manager versions so you'll need to install them first. They both automatically use the declared version of Node.js / package manager in the root package.json so you don't have to worry about it.

2. Install dependencies by running `yarn`.

```bash
$ yarn
  yarn install v1.22.19
  [1/5] üîç  Validating package.json...
  [2/5] üîç  Resolving packages...
```

3. Install either [Triplex for VS Code](https://triplex.dev/docs/get-started/vscode) or [Triplex Standalone](https://triplex.dev/docs/get-started/standalone).

4. You're now ready to start developing!

## Developing With Triplex for VS Code

With either VS Code or Cursor open, go to the `/examples` folder, find a component, and click the "Open in Triplex" Code Lens action.

## Developing With Triplex Standalone

With Triplex Standalone open, open one of the example packages and then open the component you want to develop against.

## Using Your Own Project

You can develop Triplex using your own projects instead of the example packages by updating their `.triplex/config.json` file to point to the renderer package in this repository.

Inside your project create or update the Triplex config to add the renderer property. It should point to the index file inside the renderer package in this repository. We recommend passing an absolute path.

```json
// .triplex/config.json
{
  "renderer": "/triplex/packages/renderer/src/index.tsx"
}
```
